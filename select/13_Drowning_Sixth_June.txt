When you hear the summer calling
When you see another day
Can you feel I'm almost drowning?
Can't you see I'm almost dead?
Let me try to love you harder
Let me try to go your way
Can you feel I'm almost dry?
With a smile I can't be Dead
And you see me lie
Like I am always on your way
And you see me lie
Like I'm always on your way
I'm drowning today
When you hear the summer calling
When you see another day
You can feel my head is burning
Can't you see I'm almost there?
Let me try to love you harder
Let me try to go your Way
Can you feel I'm almost dry?
With a smile I can't be dead
And you see me lie
Like I'm always on your way
And you see me lie
Like I'm always on your Way
I'm drowning today (like I'm always on your way)
I'm drowning today (like I'm always on your Way)
I'm drowning today (can't you see I am almost there?...)
I'm drowning today (with a smile I can't be Dead)
