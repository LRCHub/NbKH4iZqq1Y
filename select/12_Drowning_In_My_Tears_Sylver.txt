I need so much strength
To cut me loose
For this kind of life
I'll no longer choose
Unquenchable thirst
It keeps me alive
I fight for your love
A war to the knife
But you'll never see
I won't let you see
But you'll never see
The raindrops in my eyes
Drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears
All those nights, all these years
I'm drowning in my tears
Drowning in my teras
I'm drowning in my tears
Save my soul, kill my fears
I'm drowning in my tears
Our story's been told
Last flight of the dove
But I can't subdue
My yearning for love
Unquenchable thirst
It keeps me alive
I fight for your love
A war to the knife
But you'll never see
I won't let you see
But you'll never see
The raindrops in my eyes
