Drowning head first in my blue life jacket
Plucked from the rues of a funeral casket
Here baby cheers when I'm wandering near you
How's the broken hearted blues?

Don't overthink when they say "I told you"
Lay off the booze as the video blows you
Bring on the cheer
I want to be here but
I've got this terrible problem

Instrumental (chords of verse)

All my friends had left the feeling I'd sober
I was a chef on the Red October
Who lost his spine, who's paid to feel fine
And just for ugly babies who are often unkind
I pushed away those concerts where the privileged come to play
I chopped down disciples who'd been clean for just one day
Despite my attitude was poised to discover
I'd change the news to find just one jealous lover

And I love her on time

Loribeth:

Chocomel, fanta pop, Easter basket
Dos mojitos en la discothequa
Not supposed to eat after midnight
I think we have a terrible problem

Together:

Don't overthink when they say "I told you"
Lay off the booze as the video blows you
Bring on the cheer
I want to be here but
I think I'm turning into a monster deer
